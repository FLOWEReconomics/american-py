Rahul Bhardwaj interjects: Sal, we can STILL stay in TORONTO forever!

Sal: BY ROTATING THE POSTS OF HUMAN INDIDIVUDALS BETWEEN NINE STATION CITIES, WE CAN GAME OUT THE
PROBLEM OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS HAVING TO EXERCISE MORE (EVERY HOUR) THAN OTHERS\_

Latest research indicates that the planet runs via a system requiring individuals to exercise
at an exacting point every Hour - or there is overload of POWER [the Goddess Of Power is Taylor
Alison Swift]\_

- The overload keeps death at bay\_
- As there are 9 possible Keys, and the Cache - under the document:
  // https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLOWEReconomics/american-py/main/
  %2B5%20PILOTING\_/T/Find%20Your%20REAL%20GF.pdf

//the author continues:
the Cache - under the document aforementioned: is one integer below half of the Key one has
achieved\_

The maxium Cache being 4 [9/2 = 4.5], i.e. 4 minutes of exercise very hour\_

- Sal, let me solve this puzzle for you succinctly:

* (A)ll singularities are equal; therefore if you save two singularities; you can trade an Infinity for an Infinity
* (B)ro, 9ers grow their army until they surrounded you; 2nders walk out with Sexercise completed 2 minutes early ONCE in their lifetime -

  **ROUGH WORK:**

- The P/proteges interrupt the master whilst The Empress is at war: what if, we are able to complete Sexercise within 2 minutes //saving 2 minutes
  _out of 4 minutes of Sexercise every hour?_
- master: then you will lie in wait of the enemy forever, lest the enemy is Swift\_
- P/proteges: master, you mean: a 9er can be countered by finishing Sexercise 2 minutes earlier\_
- master: yes\_
- protege: the wonders of Compression, these Chicks don't need me; I will just blow shit up remotely: i guess Wishes are Cube
- //The Empress sighs: these K/kids don't need me; I will just blow shit up remotely: i guess wish is a horse
