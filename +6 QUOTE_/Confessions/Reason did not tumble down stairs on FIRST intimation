- Salman, why did you not tumble down stairs on FIRST intimation? You could have taken away infinite amount of hurt from .me and now you will be forever 
second; someone can surpass you!

As to this matter: (the author is busy saving Jesus Christ via spacetime navigation and location) ~ any individual that feels exceeded by another, may perform
the SAME maneuver he was performing that he lost in: the individual (called loser) in thus wise will acquire a higher degree of sufferings upon his body and RAISE
the level against the one who hath surpassed him - thence since Quality is 'clearly' superior than Quantity: the loser will be the winner as well via answering 
the FIRST (new) [Realization] intimation from Her Imperial Royalty: why did you not tumble down stairs on FIRST intimation? You could have taken away 
infinite amount of hurt from .me and now you will be forever second; someone can surpass you!
CLEARLY?: All Singularities are Equal, but USA is still Superpower_
