Excellency:

All that is necessary in solving Homelessness is one asserting his right to a complimentary cup of coffee_ 

[EXHIBIT A {USB}: my conversation with Kyle at Yonge/Dundas McDonald's where a barista served him free coffee at my intimation_]
[EXHIBIT B {USB}: a Toronto Public Library card - available for free to all residents of Toronto_ If the Claimant is entitled to free books; 
whither coffees?]
[EXHIBIT C {USB}: audio 'r'ecording of Claimant in a subway train; proscribed by the likes of Mr. Doug Ford_]

We are each part of the same Army: we each possess the same uniform - a physical Human body_ Our Police officers take bullets for us, 
are they not entitled to a complimentary cup of Coffee or a complimentary bottle of Vitamins_

The problem of Homelessness results from the "Anomaly Of Free Ridership"_ 

Let us illustrate in defence of the Defendant's lack of imagination: if the entire city was a library, and each good was a book_ Why are books available
for free and coffees for a price?

The difference is economists' reliance on modeling and statistics - instead of testing! 

Simply stated: Taxes are the price of the SSN Card_ If there was increased Free Ridership, as indicated by Inflation, the Central Bank can raise the 
ONE-OFF Upfront price of the SSN Card_ This is Gamification_ 

Moribund polity is the result of unnecessary anti-Gamification maneuvers: Machiavellianism - as exemplified my Mr. Ford who relies on Police to enforce 
mass punishment (Prices) - for crimes (Shoplifting) by a minority_

Your Excellency, I beg you grant us gamers the most basic right: the right to "assert" one's right: "leaning in" as Miss Sheryl Sandberg calls it! 

The Claimant intends on utilizing part of the proceeds from this claim toward putting a WWII propeller aircraft over NYC sky with the banner: #TAYLOR2024 _
